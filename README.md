# TTaro Minimap
This is a fully customizable minimap that enhances the gameplay.

There were similar mods - AutoSpy and BattleFrame minimaps. However, the authors are no longer playing WoWS, and their creations are deprecated. This project aims to replace these.

The mod accommodates most of the options their mods had.
Additionally, all the unique features of the mods I've published so far, are available in this package.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!

# Requirements
You must install the following in order to use the mod.
- [TTaro Mod Config](../../../TTaroModConfig)
- [DraggableUnbound2](../../../DraggableUnbound2)
