Additionally, this package includes all the unique features of the mods I've published so far.

# Features
- **Support of Drag-Drop**: You can move the minimap freely!

- **RPF Communication**: Shares the direction of your RPF, receives teammates' direction via chat, and indicates them on the map.
- **Radar/Hydro/Submarine Locator**: Shows the range of allys' consumables. The duration of active consumables is always accurate too!
- **Gradient Background**: A semi-transparent background lets you see the enemies even when the minimap is enlarged.
- **Blur Background**: Allows you to see the text with ease!

...and a lot more!
